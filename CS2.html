        <p>A line-following robot is an autonomous or semi-autonomous robot <br>designed to follow a designated path by tracking lines or patterns on the <br>ground. It employs a combination of sensors, algorithms, and actuators <br>to detect and respond to variations in the line, allowing it to navigate <br>along the desired route. These robots are highly adaptable machines <br>that have played an crucial role in a wide range of industries and fields.</p>
        <div class=line1></div>
        <p>The primary component of a line-following robot is its sensor <br>system. Typically, it uses one or more light sensors, such as infrared or <br>reflective sensors, to detect the contrast between the line and the surface. <br>These sensors provide feedback to the robot's control system, allowing it <br>to make decisions on how to adjust its movements and stay on the line.</p>

      <div class=content>
        <p>This Project utilizes infrared sensors to track lines or patterns on the ground.<br>
These sensors provide a digital reading, where black is represented as 0 and <br>
white as 1. By using multiple sensors, we can determine the exact location of <br>
the line and transmit this information to a microcontroller.<br><br>
In this project, an Arduino Uno microcontroller is employed, although other <br>
variations like Arduino Mega or Arduino Nano can also be used. The <br>
microcontroller acts as the brain of the robot, processing the sensor data <br>
and implementing specific algorithms. One popular algorithm used is the <br>
Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID), which calculates the necessary <br>
adjustments to keep the robot centered on the line.<br>

</p>
        <div class=line2></div>
        <p>To facilitate the coordination between the microcontroller and the motors, <br>I have
utilized a motor driver called L298N . The motor driver enables the <br>microcontroller 
to control the speed and direction of the motors based on <br>the sensor readings. Power 
for the motor driver is supplied by a 3x cell <br>holder, providing a 12V power source.<br><br>
  All these components are integrated onto a custom-made acrylic sheet,<br>
which serves as the chassis or base for the line following robot. The acrylic<br>
 sheet provides a stable platform for mounting the sensors, microcontroller,<br>
 motor driver, and other necessary components. By combining all these<br>
elements, the project culminates in a fully functional line following robot.
