              <p>A line-following robot is an autonomous or semi-autonomous robot designed to follow a designated path by tracking lines or patterns on the ground. It employs a combination of sensors, algorithms, and actuators to detect and respond to variations in the line, allowing it to navigate along the desired route. These robots are highly adaptable machines that have played an crucial role in a wide range of industries and fields.</p>  
              <div class=line1></div>
              <p>The primary component of a line-following robot is its sensor system. Typically, it uses one or more light sensors, such as infrared or reflective sensors, to detect the contrast between the line and the surface. These sensors provide feedback to the robot's control system, allowing it to make decisions on how to adjust its movements and stay on the line.</p>

              <p>This Project utilizes infrared sensors to track lines or patterns on the ground. These sensors provide a digital reading, where black is represented as 0 and white as 1. By using multiple sensors, we can determine the exact location of the line and transmit this information to a microcontroller.<br><br>In this project, an Arduino Uno microcontroller is employed, although other variations like Arduino Mega or Arduino Nano can also be used. The microcontroller acts as the brain of the robot, processing the sensor data and implementing specific algorithms. One popular algorithm used is the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID), which calculates the necessary adjustments to keep the robot centered on the line.</p>
              <div class=line2></div>
              <p>To facilitate the coordination between the microcontroller and the motors, I have utilized a motor driver called L298N . The motor driver enables the microcontroller to control the speed and direction of the motors based on the sensor readings. Power for the motor driver is supplied by a 3x cell holder, providing a 12V power source.<br><br>All these components are integrated onto a custom-made acrylic sheet, which serves as the chassis or base for the line following robot. The acrylic sheet provides a stable platform for mounting the sensors, microcontroller, motor driver, and other necessary components. By combining all these elements, the project culminates in a fully functional line following robot.</p>
