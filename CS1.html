        <p>Facial recognotion is a computer vision project  that invovles collection <br>
of diverse datasets, facial images, facial,videos, etc. The data is then <br>
passed to the facial features detection algorithms and APIs, which uses <br>
the variations in facial features to match the real realtime facial images <br>
and video frames with the large database of facial images. And as a result <br>
successfully recognizing face if it's matched within the provided database.</p>
        <div class=line1></div>
        <p>Facial recognition technology plays a very crucial role in enhancing <br>
security and convenience. In simple words, it accurately identifies <br>
individuals based on their unique facial features, enhancing access <br>
control and authentication processes.</p>

      <div class=content>
        <p>In this face recognition project, I utilized Jupyter Notebook as my Integrated <br>
Development Environment (IDE), coupled with combination of Python <br>
programming language and OpenCV.<br><br>
The project consists of several essential steps. First, real-time footage of <br>
faces is captured using cameras or video sources. The captured frames are <br>
then processed to detect and extract facial features using advanced algorithms <br>
and OpenCV's pre-trained models. These features include facial landmarks, <br>
facial expressions, and other unique characteristics.
</p>
        <div class=line2></div>
        <p>Next, the extracted facial features are compared and matched with a vast <br>
database containing an extensive collection of human facial images. This <br>
database serves as a reference for recognition. <br><br>
Various techniques, such as deep learning models, are employed to ensure <br>
accurate and reliable matching between the captured facial features and the <br>
database. Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks <br>
(CNNs) are very well known in the field of face recognition because of their <br>
rigorous training on a vast database of facial images.<br>

        <p>The objective of this project is to develop an accurate system for <br>
automatically identifying individuals based on their facial features. <br>
The primary aim is to leverage computer vision techniques, machine learning <br>
algorithms, and deep neural networks to achieve high-performance face <br>
recognition. By accurately identifying individuals, the system can be <br>
applied to various applications, including access control, surveillance, <br>
and secure authentication.</p>
        <div class=line3></div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Access control: It can be employed in access control systems, <br>such as in secure facilities, airports, or smart homes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Security and surveillence: It can enhance surveillance systems <br>by automatically detecting and identifying individuals of interest.
          </li>
          <li>
            Secure authentication: It offers a convenient and reliable <br>alternative to traditional password-based authentication;
